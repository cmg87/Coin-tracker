# Project-1
create a fully functioning site that makes use of API calls, uses firebase or some other form of persistent storage and is presented in a polished UI that is mobile responsive.
 
 the team started with brainstorming around the idea that there should be a quick, easy, and educational "encyclopedia" for new investors
 to visit as a resource  for learning about cryptocurrencies. 
 
 This quickly developed into a site that provides useful and easy to read data on a wide variety of coins that is presented in a visually appealing format without any bloatware from other sites or data on investments not related directly to Cryptocurrency.
 
 This simplicity allows for a much wider demographic to educate themselves and dissect data without feeling lost or overwhelmed. Thanks to the use of a personal dashboard traffic is driven back to Coin tracker by giving the user a landing area to quickly access data specific to the coins they are personally interested in.
 
 With a solid functional foundation the ability to grow coin tracker with new features and monetize the site is endless. As the user base increases a chargeable "premium" user account could be created to give additional chart data functionality that could permit subscribers surgical precision on time frames and statistics.
